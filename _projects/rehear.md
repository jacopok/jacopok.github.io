Current data analysis pipelines assume the entirety of a gravitational wave
signal is available right away.
What happens if we relax this assumption?

We might involve particle filters or Kalman filters
in order to have something like a continuously-updating representation
of the posterior distribution.

But, for the next observing run this is not the first thing to look at.
We already have an early-warning alert pipeline; we just need to
make communication with telescopes efficient, and in order to do so
we need to make simulations.
