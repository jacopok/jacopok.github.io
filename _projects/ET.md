Einstein Telescope ([webpage](https://www.et-gw.eu/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Telescope))
is a gravitational wave interferometer in the planning phase.
It will be underground, cryogenic, and sensitive at much lower frequencies
than current detectors.

I am a member of the ET collaboration, mostly working on the acceleration of
parameter estimation.

## Waveform acceleration

Part of this work is [`mlgw_bns`](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns),
a fast waveform approximant for binary neutron star mergers.

Several improvements to it are planned and tracked as issues in the repo;
some are [technical improvements](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atechnical-improvement) and some are about the inclusion of
[additional physics information](https://github.com/jacopok/mlgw_bns/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aadditional-physics).

## Parameter estimation reframing

Can we change our approach to the analysis of long signals?
Perhaps, [`rehear`](/projects/rehear) might help!
