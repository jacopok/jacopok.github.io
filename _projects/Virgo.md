The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration will start its fourth observing run,
O4, in spring 2023 (hopefully).
I recently joined the collaboration, and I will help in this 
observing run.

Specifically, I'm working to automate the waveform review process,
hopefully allowing for the use of eccentric waveforms before the end of O4.
