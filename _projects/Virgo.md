The LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has started its fourth observing run,
O4, in spring 2023, and it will continue until late 2025 (see the [observing plan](https://observing.docs.ligo.org/plan/)), with Virgo joining in March 2024.

As part of the LVK collaboration, I'm

- helping out in waveform review,
- participating in the Rapid Response Team,
- helping with the development of [BAYESTAR](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/ligo.skymap/#localization).
