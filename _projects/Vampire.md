A game for fairly large groups of people, fun to do in city centers!
A vampire stalks the population, and can turn unsuspecting citizens into its ilk.

## Rules

- People can only stay within a __selected area__ (shown below is an example in L'Aquila)
- Vampires may infect players by __touching__ them
    - optionally, it can be nice for every player to be carrying a marker pen, and for the vampire to mark its victim with two dots on the neck
- The vampire's aim is to __capture__ as many people as possible, 
    the other players' aim is to __not be caught__ for the duration
- If a player is caught, they become __allies of the vampire__ and can begin to 
    hunt other humans themselves

### For each round

- A vampire is chosen randomly amongst the participants
- A start time, grace period and end time are determined
    - the __grace period__ should only be of two-three minutes to allow people to spread out
    - the __end time__ should be set so that the full round lasts around half an hour
- As the "whistle is blown", the hunt is on! 

### Points

- Each human __surviving__ to the end of the round gets _5 points_
- The __original vampire__ gets _2 points_ for each human they (directly) capture
- __Second generation vampires__ get _1 point_ for each human they capture
