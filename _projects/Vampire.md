A game for fairly large groups of people, fun to do in city centers!
A vampire stalks the population, and can turn unsuspecting citizens into its ilk.

## Rules

- People can only stay within a **selected area** (shown below is an example in L'Aquila)
- Vampires may infect players by **touching** them
  - optionally, it can be nice for every player to be carrying a marker pen, and for the vampire to mark its victim with two dots on the neck
- The vampire's aim is to **capture** as many people as possible,
  the other players' aim is to **not be caught** for the duration
- If a player is caught, they become **allies of the vampire** and can begin to
  hunt other humans themselves

### For each round

- A vampire is chosen randomly amongst the participants
- A start time, grace period and end time are determined
  - the **grace period** should only be of two-three minutes to allow people to spread out
  - the **end time** should be set so that the full round lasts around half an hour
- As the "whistle is blown", the hunt is on!

### Points

- Each human **surviving** to the end of the round gets _5 points_
- The **original vampire** gets _2 points_ for each human they (directly) capture
- **Second generation vampires** get _1 point_ for each human they capture
