This is a [West Marches](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/120770/what-defines-a-west-marches-campaign)-style Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition campaign called **Val Celia**.

It is co-run by me in L'Aquila and by Lorenzo in Trieste; parties can form in either town,
but they will always interact with the same world, and they will hear news from one another.

In this website you will be able to find

- [an introduction for players](/val_celia/player_intro)
- [details on the rules we're adopting](/val_celia/player_rules)
- [the missions that are currently available](/val_celia/player_missions)

Everything's in Italian at the moment, sorry!
We're working on a translation, it will be available soon, hopefully.

To organize sessions, we can use [this Telegram group](https://t.me/+if1NQY248y5lNzE0).
It's not a requirement to be part of this group in order to play, it's just to make it easier
