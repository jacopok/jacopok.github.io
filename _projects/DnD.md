I am currently DMing two Dungeons and Dragons, 5th edition campaigns (on and off, neither is regularly scheduled at the moment).

One is a West Marches-style sandbox campaign, with some fairytale vibes: [Val Celia](/val_celia).

The other is an adventure in the far North, to recover and bring back ancient artifacts and cure a dangerous disease. It is based on the [Frozen Sick](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/wa/frozen-sick#FrozenSick) adventure from the Wildemount setting, but we've far deviated from that by now.
