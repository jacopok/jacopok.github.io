I've ran:

- "The Haunting" from the [quick-start rules](https://www.chaosium.com/content/FreePDFs/CoC/CHA23131%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu%207th%20Edition%20Quick-Start%20Rules.pdf) - it was supposed to be a one or two-shot, turned into a four-session scenario with some heavy homebrew. Pierpaolo helped me in running it as a co-GM. 
    We had five players, four survived, but evil still walks free.
- "[The Lightless Beacon](https://www.chaosium.com/content/FreePDFs/WeAreAllUs/2019/The%20Lightless%20Beacon%20-%20Call%20of%20Cthulhu.pdf)", a true one-shot. Very fun, ran it twice, the first time with two players (Giorgio, Carlo: RPG newbies) and no casualties, the second with five players (the hometown group + my sister) and one casualty.

Also, I've played in a long one shot Keeper'd by Pierpaolo, "Blackwater Creek". 
Great scenario, very spooky!
