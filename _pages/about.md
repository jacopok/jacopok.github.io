Hi! I'm Jacopo, a PhD student at [GSSI](https://www.gssi.it/people/students/students-physics/item/15633-tissino-jacopo), working on gravitational wave data analysis and astrophysics.

My aim is to help in developing the techniques we will need in order to analyze the data coming from 
the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as [Einstein Telescope](../_projects/et.md) and LISA.
