Hi! I'm Jacopo, a PhD student at the Gran Sasso Science Institute, working on gravitational wave data analysis and astrophysics.

My aim, academically, is to help in developing the techniques we will need in order to analyze the data coming from
the next generation of gravitational wave detectors, such as [Einstein Telescope](/projects/ET), [LGWA](/projects/LGWA) and LISA.

I am also involved in the [LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration](/projects/Virgo), in order to learn about the state of the art for gravitational waves, and help in the wonderful effort of measuring them as best as we can.

The [papers](/publications) I've published so far are related to fast waveform generation and lunar gravitational wave detection, but [more are coming](/projects)!
Also, here you can find information about my upcoming [talks](/talks).

In this website you can find information about the big, sandbox-style **Dungeons and Dragons** campaign I'm co-running: [Val Celia](/val_celia).

I like making **videos**: some of them are related to physics, like [this visualization of Effective One Body eccentric/hyperbolic orbits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRF-Gc0voik) or [this visual explanation of the different ways to parametrize an eccentric orbit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr9t7SLo0I0).

Some of them are about my beloved mountains, both [here in Abruzzo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncHrPkNhl6Y) as well as [back in Northern Italy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfVHq-Rr2GY).
Some shots were also featured in [this GSSI advertisement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhupJeXXv8Y)!
