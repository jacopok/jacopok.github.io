This is a [West Marches](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/120770/what-defines-a-west-marches-campaign)-style Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition campaign called **Val Celia**.

It is co-run by me in L'Aquila and by Lorenzo in Trieste; parties can form in either town,
but they will always interact with the same world, and they will hear news from one another.

In this website you will be able to find

- [an introduction for players, with information about the setting](/val_celia/player_intro)
- [details on the rules we're adopting](/val_celia/player_rules)
- [the missions that are currently available](/val_celia/player_missions)
- [a list of all the adventurers in Celina](/val_celia/pokedex)
- [reports by the adventurers on the previous sessions](/val_celia/player_reports)
- [details on the main places in the starting town, Celina](/val_celia/celina)

Everything's in Italian at the moment, sorry!
We're working on a translation, it will be available soon, hopefully.

To organize sessions, we can use [this Telegram group](https://t.me/+if1NQY248y5lNzE0).
It's not a requirement to be part of this group in order to play, it's just to make it easier
