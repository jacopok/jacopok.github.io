Multimessenger astrophysics --- detecting a single source with two or more 
"messengers" (photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, cosmic rays...) ---
is super cool!
But what do we actually learn from it, scientifically?

## Which combinations?

- GWs(BNS) + kilonova
- GWs(BNS) + GRB
- GWs(SN) + neutrinos

## Confirmation

(photons + GWs)
We get extrinsic confirmation that the gravitational wave signal was indeed
of astrophysical origin. 

## Simultaneous analyisis and correlation

In principle, it's great!
This was actually done with GW170817,
