Multimessenger astrophysics --- detecting a single source with two or more 
"messengers" (photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, cosmic rays...) ---
is super cool!
But what do we actually learn from it, scientifically, that we wouldn't be able to
by just seeing the events by themselves?

## Which combinations?

- binary neutron star merger (BNS): gravitational waves (GW) + optical/infrared/ultraviolet (kilonova (KN)) + high-energy (gamma ray burst (GRB))
- supernova (SN): gravitational waves (GW) + optical (SN) + neutrinos

Other combinations are also interesting, but here I'll talk about these ones specifically.

## Confirmation

(photons + GWs)
We get extrinsic confirmation that the gravitational wave signal was indeed
of astrophysical origin. 

BNS + short GRB: we get confirmation that short GRBs come from neutron 
star mergers, and 

## Simultaneous analyisis and correlation

In principle, it's great!
This was actually done with GW170817, by giving combined KN and GW constraints on
the EoS. 
But really, the analyses are mostly independent --- the KN and GW parameters are 
different, intersecting somehow in the EoS-dependent ones and inclination.

What can we actually learn from it?

- Tighter constraints on parameters - e.g. inclination must be low if we see the GRB
- correlating events: which BNS masses / spins / whatever can actually give rise to a GRB?

## Cosmology

The precise localization from a KN detection can allow us to identify a specific 
galaxy from which the signal is coming. Then, we have 

- the spectroscopic measurement of the redshift $z$ from that galaxy
- the independent gravitational wave measurement of $d_L$

which is a datapoint we can use to constrain $H(z)$ (or $H_0$).
