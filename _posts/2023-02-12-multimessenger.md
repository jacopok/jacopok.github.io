Multimessenger astrophysics --- detecting a single source with two or more 
"messengers" (photons, neutrinos, gravitational waves, cosmic rays...) ---
is super cool!
But what do we actually learn from it, scientifically, that we wouldn't be able to
by just seeing the events by themselves?

From "Multi-messenger Astrophysics with the
Highest Energy Counterparts of Gravitational
Waves" by Antonio Stamerra, Barbara Patricelli, Imre Bartos,
and Marica Branchesi.

- Do short GRBs have VHE emission? Is the VHE emission dependent on the
progenitor (binary mergers or core collapse supernovae)? How does it depend on
the environment of the source?
The emergence of an observable VHE component in GRB helps us in advancing
our knowledge of their nature and, in case of short GRB, in their relation
to BNS mergers. The broadband spectral energy distribution of the few TeV-
GRB observed until now are important in removing the degeneracy of emission
models. These are just the first steps in a new field that will need further
exploration:
-  To which extent can the joint detection of VHE emission and GW radiation
improve the insight on the physics of compact objects and on the acceleration
processes and emission mechanisms?
- How will the improved sensitivity of the next generation IACTs and gravita-
tional wave interferometers improve such insight?
-  Which are the best observational strategies and selection criteria on the
expected large number of GW events, which can be implemented to maximize
the scientific impact of these observations?
Emission of high-energy neutrinos in the prompt phase of the GRB appears now
disfavoured by the lack of coincidence of GRB with the TeV-PeV neutrinos
detected by IceCube. New theoretical and observational efforts have been
set to explain it, and the new multi-messenger scenario will provide further
opportunities to test their predictions. Is there an observable connection between
GRB and high-energy neutrinos and between gravitational waves and high-
energy neutrinos? Which are the next key observations that can provide useful
constraints?
- Do some binary black hole mergers produce multi-messenger emission?

## Which combinations?

- binary neutron star merger (BNS): gravitational waves (GW) + optical/infrared/ultraviolet (kilonova (KN)) + high-energy (gamma ray burst (GRB))
- supernova (SN): gravitational waves (GW) + optical (SN) + neutrinos

Other combinations are also interesting, but here I'll talk about these ones specifically.

## Confirmation

(photons + GWs)
We get extrinsic confirmation that the gravitational wave signal was indeed
of astrophysical origin. 

BNS + short GRB: we get confirmation that short GRBs come from neutron 
star mergers, and 

## Simultaneous analyisis and correlation

In principle, it's great!
This was actually done with GW170817, by giving combined KN and GW constraints on
the EoS. 
But really, the analyses are mostly independent --- the KN and GW parameters are 
different, intersecting somehow in the EoS-dependent ones and inclination.

What can we actually learn from it?

- Tighter constraints on parameters - e.g. inclination must be low if we see the GRB
- correlating events: which BNS masses / spins / whatever can actually give rise to a GRB?

## Cosmology

The precise localization from a KN detection can allow us to identify a specific 
galaxy from which the signal is coming. Then, we have 

- the spectroscopic measurement of the redshift $z$ from that galaxy
- the independent gravitational wave measurement of $d_L$

which is a datapoint we can use to constrain $H(z)$ (or $H_0$).
